in this phase we do the testing of the action tag of the form in the
html document 

action tag determines that of which @app.route will the post fxn get
called 

so on submitting the form : 
post will be done by the browser 
that post request will go to the server
but which @app.route should actually accept that post request ?

that is determined using the action tag

note : 
diff btw redirect and render template : 

render template will render the template from the templates folder only 
but in case we want to redirect to another website then we shall use
redirect fxn 


so in case we dont mention the action tag in the form of the html then :

the form will be posted at the @app.route of the same url

thus the if block will be called of the same @app.route


Note :

avoid using render template in case you want the user to redirect to another page:
